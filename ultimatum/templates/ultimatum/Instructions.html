        Instructions

    <div class="panel-body">

        <p>
            First, every player will be randomly paired with another player. In
            other words, you will have a counterpart, but you will not be told
            who it is.
            Your identity will also remain hidden from your counterpart.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two participants in a pair will have two different roles: the
            <strong>proposer</strong> and the <strong>responder</strong>.
            You will be assigned randomly to a role, and it will be displayed
            on the next page.
        </p>

        <p>
            The two of you will together receive {{ Constants.endowment }}. The
            experiment is about how to divide this amount.
            The proposer will make the responder a take-it-or-leave-it offer,
            which the responder can accept or reject.
            If the offer is rejected, both will
            receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}.

        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Proposer's role
        </h4>

        <p>
            The proposer has {{ Constants.offer_choices_count }} options on how to divide the {{ Constants.endowment }}
            between the two players. For example:
            <br> 0 for the responder (the proposer keeps 100)
            <br> 5 for the responder (the proposer keeps 95)
            <br> 37 for the responder (the proposer keeps 63)
            <br> 100 for the responder (the proposer keeps 0)
            <br> etc.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Responder's role
        </h4>

        <p>
            While the proposer makes the offer, the responder need to select the <strong>minimal amount</strong> of
            points he will <strong>accept</strong> and the <strong>maximal amount</strong> of points he will <strong>reject</strong>.
            After the proposer has made the offer, it will be either
            accepted or rejected according to the responder's choices.
        </p>

        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
            Results
        </h4>

        <p>
            A results page will be displayed once both players have made
            their decisions and those decisions have been implemented.
            Here, it will be shown whether the offer was accepted or
            rejected.
        </p>


        Furthermore, one of the following two payoffs will be displayed:
        <ul>
            <li>If the offer is accepted, the players will receive a payoff
                accordingly
            </li>
            <li>If the offer is rejected, both players will
                receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
